# Radool's Realm

Three simple CTF problems about data integrity.
There is a new video game series called "Radool's Realm,"
which has an achievement system. To get the flag, you 
need to convince the game server you've gotten
all the achievements. This requires tampering with a 
save file in various way.

# Playing
To play the problems, you will need to have a recent version of Java 
installed. Each problem requires that you run the server jar first
(from this directory), then run the game client jar (found in the 
level subdirectories). Look in the level folders for more 
specific instructions.
